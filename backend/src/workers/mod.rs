//! SCHEDULER APPROACH: Option B — Custom Tokio interval loop with cron crate
//! Rationale: We require strict control over execution guarantees such as distributed locking, timeouts, retries, and history logging. A custom loop using `tokio::time::sleep_until` and the `cron` crate allows us to wrap the execution precisely in a Redis lock and accurately handle timeouts using `tokio::time::timeout`.
